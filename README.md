Sync is used to tell the Launcher when something has changed (banner, new version released). It helps keep you up to date and not need to re-open the launcher to see changes.

SyncDetect is used to detect when to download a new Sync. This saves on bandwidth, for us, and internet connection, for you. It also allows you to check the Sync more frequently.
